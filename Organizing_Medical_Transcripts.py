#You have been provided with an anonymized dataset of medical transcriptions organized by specialty, transcriptions.csv.

#Use the OpenAI API to extract "age", "medical_specialty", and a new data field to store the recommended treatment extracted from each transcription.
#Match each recommended treatment with the corresponding International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code, and save your answers in a pandas DataFrame named df_structured.
#*Note that when clicking "Submit Project" it may take a while for the code to execute and the tests to run as you are interacting with the OpenAI API.
